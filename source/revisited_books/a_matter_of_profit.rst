A Matter of Profit
==================

by *Hilari Bell*

I remember seeing this with the original cover in the library when I was growing up and thinking it looked too weird. I'd read a few other books by the author and mentioned it to a friend, who suggested I try it. I ended up liking it. I was probably 12 or 13 when I read it, so now it has been about 18 years. I still liked it.

The setting was not unique (what is it with desert planets?), but the plot mostly worked. I can understand being frustrated with how clueless Ahvren is, but, in real life, it's harder to know what's going on than one would think. I appreciated the overall theme of tolerance and understanding.
