I first ran into *Conrad's Fate* in a book store in Victoria, BC, when I was on a road trip with my parents. Having enough books to read on a road trip was always a problem: I'd pack fifteen or so and be done with them in a week and a half, so we'd have to keep stopping by bookstores. The Pacific Northwest is good for book stores, so it was easy this trip.

Anyway, *Conrad's Fate* is part of Diana Wynne Jones' *Chrestomanci* series, which are about a parallel world to our own where magic is common. The titular character, Chrestomanci (though the word is the job title rather than his name which is Christopher), is sort of the chief magic cop. 

   As he shut the door in his soundless way, I could hear the voice of Mr. Prendergast outside it. “I tell you I’m quite capable of opening a door, you pear-shaped freak!”
