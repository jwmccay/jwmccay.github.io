# Library as Tonic

Basically my relationship with libraries throughout time

- How I'd go get a bunch of books in college
- Waiting for the bus
- How it felt as a young child browsing the shelves
- Different layouts of the Morro Bay Library

Some website name ideas
- `library-tonic`
- `library-cordial`
- `library-solace`
