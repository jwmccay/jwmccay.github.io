Beatnik Softball
================

This is another one I wrote in college, around the same time as :ref:`Courier`.

    <p>I was out walking the fire trails one evening. On my way back I passed by the softball field at Clark-Kerr. It was in use. The game seemed pretty normal, until I realised they weren't cheering the batters as softballers are wont to do. Intrigued, I stood to watch for a bit.</p>
    <p>At every hit, instead of cheering, the team in the dugout snapped their fingers. I thought this was odd and looked more closely. Instead of water coolers, they had jugs of coffee. Intead of baseball caps, they had berets. The batters weren't chewing, but they were smoking. The announcer was talking in unrhymed verse.</p>
    <p>When I had seen all this, I started in surprise. It was...beatnik softball.</p>
    <p>    (Note: I didn't actually see this, but I did see a softball game at Clark-Kerr while thinking about the beat movement. Then this happened.)</p>
