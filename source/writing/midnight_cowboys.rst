Midnight Cowboys
================

Thoughts

* Made the hike many times but only have two visual memories from that hike
   * Moonlight view from the summit
   * Showering at 4 AM after getting back (no competition for hot water)
* I have a few other visual memories from other hikes that are very distinct
    * snake
    * Stickers
    * Sunset dinner
    * walking down at night (often confused with this hike)
* Who was it with?
   * three other people:
       * Tim - swim, wanted to go on the hike
       * Tanner
       * Someone else (possibly Tanner's brother Hunter?)
