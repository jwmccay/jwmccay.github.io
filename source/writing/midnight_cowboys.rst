The Ride of the Midnight Cowboys - Redux
========================================

My summer job in high school was as an instructor at Pico Blanco Scout Reseveration, the Boy Scout cocamp in Big Sur, California. I worked there for three summers teaching basic outdoors skills. There is a lot to be said about Pico, but much of it would be common to anyone who has worked at a scout camp.

Instead, this passage is about climbing a nearby mountain--Mount Pico Blanco, the namesake of the camp--entirely after dark. It is also a meditation on memory and how repetition and photographs affect memory. This was a formative experience for me. However, I have no photographs of it (it was 2011 and in the dark), and only did it once. It has been an interesting exercise to see how much of it I recall with nothing to jog my memory.

We would lead a hike for scouts up Mt. Pico every week. It would start at 4 PM on Wednesday, and we would get to the top around sunset, spend the nigh, and come back in time for breakfast. It was arouund 3.5 miles but very steep. The route went from the main camp at 900' up another 1000' to a ride. Then it went along the ridge for a few hundred yards before dipping down into a canyon. In the canyon, the trail went along through a typical steep section with Bay Laurels and Madrones that was difficult passage due to a recent fire. Then it crossed the bottom of bottom of the canyon in an area with a small redwood grove before climbing up the other side and going through a brushy area. Before reaching the bottom of the canyon again (where there is a public backcountry campground), the trail reached a flat area we called "Tick Meadows" for obvious reasons. At Tick Meadows, we would leave the trail and head straight up the side of Mt. Pico to the top. The return route just retraced the steps. 

I have a number of memories of this from the many times I did it while leading hikes: nice sunsets over fog, scouts being very tired, one time a rattlsnake, bedding down either at the top or at a flat spot where an old mining road ended, looking along the summit ridge, etc. It has been pleasant to think back on the weekly hikes. I have many clear, almost photographic memories of them, even though I have no actual photographs, which contrasts with the midnight hike I am about to describe. The differennce, I suppose, is that I only did the midnight hike once and repetition reinforces memory.

The actual "Ride of the Midnight Cowboys - Redux" was on a Saturday night, the only night of the week with only staff in camp. It had been done once before that I know of, though no-one from the first time was along when I did it. The first group came up with the name, hence the "Redux" in the title. The goal was to leave after sunset, climb Mt. Pico, and come back before sunrise.

I do not remember who said we should do it. It may have been Tim, who worked in aquatics. I do remember he wanted to get out of camp on a hike because aquatics staff were stuck at the lake all week. Other than Tim and me, Tanner and one other person went along. Tanner worked with me in the nature lodge and ended up having long tenure in Pico (he was there when I went back for a visit five or six years later). The remaining person may have been Tanner's older brother, Hunter, but I do not remember clearly. 

Thoughts
========

* Made the hike many times but only have two visual memories from that hike
   * Moonlight view from the summit
   * Showering at 4 AM after getting back (no competition for hot water)
* I have a few other visual memories from other hikes that are very distinct
    * snake
    * Stickers
    * Sunset dinner
    * walking down at night (often confused with this hike)
* Who was it with?
   * three other people:
       * Tim - swim, wanted to go on the hike
       * Tanner
       * Someone else (possibly Tanner's brother Hunter?)
