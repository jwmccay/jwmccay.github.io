The Ride of the Midnight Cowboys - Redux
========================================

My summer job in high school was as an instructor at Pico Blanco Scout Reseveration, the Boy Scout cocamp in Big Sur, California. I worked there for three summers teaching basic outdoors skills. There is a lot to be said about Pico, but much of it would be common to anyone who has worked at a scout camp.

Instead, this passage is about climbing a nearby mountain--Mount Pico Blanco, the namesake of the camp--entirely after dark. It is also a meditation on memory and how photographs affect memory. This was a formative experience for me. However, I have no photographs of it (it was 2011 and in the dark), so it has been an interesting exercise to see how much of it I recall with nothing to jog my memory.

Thoughts
========

* Made the hike many times but only have two visual memories from that hike
   * Moonlight view from the summit
   * Showering at 4 AM after getting back (no competition for hot water)
* I have a few other visual memories from other hikes that are very distinct
    * snake
    * Stickers
    * Sunset dinner
    * walking down at night (often confused with this hike)
* Who was it with?
   * three other people:
       * Tim - swim, wanted to go on the hike
       * Tanner
       * Someone else (possibly Tanner's brother Hunter?)
