Libby Rankings
==============
I wrote a `tool to rank books I've read <https://github.com/jwmccay/libby-bracket>`_ and its results. It takes a reading history json from Libby and sets up a bracket-style competion in the terminal.

When I did it, my the top twelve books, in no particular order, were:

* *The Tombs of Atuan* by Ursula K. Le Guin
* *Drowned Ammet* by Diana Wynne Jones
* *Consider Phlebas* by Iain M. Banks
* *The Left Hand of Darkness* by Ursula K. Le Guin
* *Lirael* by Garth Nix
* *The Goblin Emperor* by Katherine Addison
* *The Witness for the Dead* by Katherine Addison
* *Terrier* by Tamora Pierce
* *Pineapple Street* by Jenny Jackson
* *Conrad's Fate* by Diana Wynne Jones
* *The Good Shepherd* by C. S. Forester
* *The Merlin Conspiracy* by Diana Wynne Jones

The Libby history I have only covers a few years, and it misses out on books I own, books that are hard to find, and physical copies.  However, my penchant for re-reading makes it pretty reflective of books that I really like.
